<h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>Patrick Henry was born to his parents John and Sarah Henry. His father was a Scotish immigrant who taught his son to be studious and even taught him Latin. His early life consisted of many failures such as when he opened a store for himself at the age of 16, an endeavor which eventually failed. This did not stop him though, he eventually taught himself law and became a lawyer. Henry was a moving orator who was able to reach peoples hearts, not just logistical arguments. Henry was able to use this power of word to influence much of early America. He openly opposed the English Crown where others stood passively by. He was a major opposer of things such as the Stamp Act in 1765 and came out with his most famous speech opposing the Crown in 1775 ending his address to the congress with the words that still resonate today: "Give me liberty or give me death." After the founding of the United States Patrick Henry served as the first governor of Virginia and also played a major role in making sure the peoples' rights were protected as a huge proponent for the Bill of Rights. Patrick Henry's deeds are not easily overlooked, nor should they be. He is one of the many reasons our country is what it is today.
